              Mental health refers to our emotional wellbeing, it is all about how we think, feel and behave.
              The relevance of working with patients with mental health problems for me will be a challenge to start with.
              While on my placement I come across many patients why are suffering with Alzheimer and Dementia and most are suffering with mental health disorders of various kinds.

              Mental health is a term that encompasses a range of experiences and situations. 
              It can be an on going experience from mental wellbeing through to a severe and enduring mental illness affecting a person’s overall emotional and psychological condition.
